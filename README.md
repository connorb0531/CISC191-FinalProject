# CISC191 Final Project - Task Manager
The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing daily and/or future tasks. 

* Task Management: The application provides a user-friendly interface for adding, 
viewing, and deleting tasks. Users can input task names, descriptions, and due dates, 
enabling them to keep track of their tasks easily.

* Dynamic Title Display: The application's main window dynamically displays the number 
of remaining tasks, providing users with instant information about their task load.

* Task Filtering: Users can search for tasks by their names, thanks to a search input 
field. The application supports real-time filtering, allowing users to find specific 
tasks quickly.

* Task Description: The application enables users to view task descriptions in a 
separate window. This feature assists users in understanding task details without 
cluttering the main interface.

* Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed, which moves them to a separate 
section for completed tasks. Completed tasks are displayed with a distinct color for 
easy differentiation.

* Task Graph Visualization: The application offers a graphical representation of 
completed tasks over time. Users can view a line chart that displays the progression 
of completed tasks, helping them analyze their productivity trends.

* Auto-Save: The application automatically saves task data every 5 seconds, ensuring 
that users' task information is not lost in the event of an unexpected shutdown or 
application crash.
